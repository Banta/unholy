          $ UNHOLY $

  Compile Ruby to Python bytecode.
  And, in addition, translate that
  bytecode back to Python source
  code using Decompyle (included.)


         $ INSTALL $

  First, install decompyle:

  > cd decompyle
  > python setup.py build
  # python setup.py install

  Then, in the main directory, use
  the tools.

            ---

  To compile Ruby to a .pyc:

  > bin/unholy test.rb
  > python test.rb.pyc
  
            ---

  To translate to Python:

  > decompyle test.rb.pyc > test.py

            ---

  And, to view the disassembled
  bytes:
  
  > bin/py-dis test.rb.pyc

  Thanks to Ned Batchelder for his
  rather juicy posts on dissecting
  Python bytecode.  It is only too
  bad that a Rubyist got a hold of
  them. :(
